# machsec

A comprehensive binary security analysis tool that detects and reports on security mitigations enabled in Mach-O executables for macOS and iOS. Originally designed for ELF binaries, machsec has been fully ported to support Apple's Mach-O format with enhanced detection capabilities for Apple platform-specific security features.

## Features

machsec analyzes Mach-O binaries for the following security mitigations:

### Core Memory Protection Features
- **RELRO** (Relocation Read-Only) - Limited support on macOS due to Mach-O format differences
- **Stack Canaries** - Stack smashing protection via compiler-generated canaries with symbol and disassembly detection
- **NX Bit** (No-eXecute) - Non-executable stack/heap protection (enabled by default on modern macOS)
- **PIE** (Position Independent Executable) - Address space layout randomization support

### Path and Runtime Security
- **RPATH/RUNPATH** - Dynamic library search path security analysis with @rpath detection
- **FORTIFY_SOURCE** - Enhanced bounds checking for standard library functions  
- **Symbol Stripping** - Binary obfuscation and debugging information removal

### Advanced Modern Mitigations
- **UBSan** (Undefined Behavior Sanitizer) - Runtime undefined behavior detection
- **ASAN** (Address Sanitizer) - Memory error detection
- **Control Flow Integrity (CFI)** - Modern ROP/JOP attack prevention
- **Intel CET** (Control-flow Enforcement Technology) - Not available on macOS (Intel x86-specific)
- **Stack Clash Protection** - Large stack allocation attack prevention
- **Heap Hardening** - Heap corruption detection mechanisms
- **Integer Overflow Protection** - Arithmetic overflow detection

### macOS/iOS-Specific Security Features
- **Sandbox** (App Sandbox) - macOS/iOS application sandboxing with entitlement analysis
- **Hardened Runtime** - macOS runtime hardening protections
- **Library Validation** - Ensures only system-signed libraries can be loaded
- **Code Signing** - Binary signature verification for macOS/iOS
- **PAC** (Pointer Authentication Code) - ARM64 hardware-assisted code integrity for Apple Silicon and iOS devices

## Installation
